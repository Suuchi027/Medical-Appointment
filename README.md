Age Group Trends: Identified that patients aged 0 and 1 had the highest appointment show rates (~80%).
Neighborhood Impact: Discovered consistent show rates (~80%) across various neighborhoods.
Scholarship Influence: Found that patients with scholarships had a slightly lower show rate (75%) compared to those without (80%).
Health Conditions: Patients with hypertension or diabetes showed higher adherence to appointments compared to those without these conditions.
SMS Reminders: Noted that patients who did not receive SMS reminders had a higher show rate (84%) compared to those who did (72%).
